define a function taking matrix, vector and scalar and decideing whether the vector is an eigenvector

decide given a matrix of Ints whether there is a saddle point

return value of a saddle point, and / or its position

don't use (!!)

given an Int, return identity matrix of the given dimerison

given i, j, return a matrix with 1 in ith row, jth column...(others are all 0)
